Bony: An automated approach towards automated generation of large combinational benchmark circuits


Due to the proprietary nature of large industrial circuits and limitations in gate count of ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, an automated benchmark generation algorithm is proposed to generate large combinational circuits. The tool is written using Python. Best with Python 2.7.x version.
